                            Embarked on software imaging project (3rd year at University) which provided insight into
                            the
                            fundamental principles of using MATLAB (Numerical computing environment) software
                            application
                            Learned how to manipulate images by making use of algorithms and colour differentiation
                            Updated supervisor by highlighting certain elements in the application which inhibited my
                            progression into solving assignment problem
                            Practically understood steps by sitting down with supervisor to learn and debug areas which
                            werenâ€™t being properly understood by the system

                            The group sectioned a portion of the time to develop soft skills and feedback sessions to
                            review and improve individual performance
                            The initial step included delegating research tasks, editing and PowerPoint presentation
                            tasks
                            to appropriate members based on their experience, skills and confidence
                            Interchangeable one-to-one sessions helped develop strong communication skills and social
                            sites
                            part of the University network allowed for further content sharing and networking
                            Each member at the end of the time period was confident enough to part take in intelligent
                            face-to-face discussion transforming members of the team to supervisor midway during
                            presentation. This yielded strong end results and boosted motivation

                            Maintenance of stock merchandise and mutual group communication was necessary in making
                            sure
                            effort was balanced between the store and helping customers whilst maintaining a

                            demeanour
                            Joining a team at HMRC whose vision was to develop a system software to help the employed

                            update on company developments, delays, software enhancements, timetables, job
                            opportunities,
                            emergency queries and much more. Acted as a one-way portal for all information
                            The above opportunity not only enhanced Microsoft office skills but general confidence in
                            chairing meetings, resolving conflicts and most importantly building a rapporteur of
                            persuasive
                            tactics to accept my point of view
